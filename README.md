# RustSpaCy-Bindings\n\nThis is a collection of Rust bindings for the [spaCy Python NLP library](https://spacy.io). This library is still a work in progress and is being actively developed by the new owner, NINETEENTOP.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use these bindings for sentence similarity calculation.\n\n```rust\nlet spacy = spacy::Module::init();\n  spacy.load("en_core_web_lg");\n  let pangram1 = spacy::nlp("With tenure, Suzieâ€™d have all the more leisure for yachting, but her publications are no good.");\n  let pangram2 = spacy::nlp("Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes.");\n  pangram1\n    .call("similarity")\n    .args(pangram2)\n    .kwargs("")\n    .invoke();\n\n```\n
